# sidehustle
Please note this project was written from scratch as both a proof of concept, and as a real enterprise level type project for my portfolio.
Please understand there was no outside coding by anyone else but me, with minimal use of libraries.The overall code stored in this git does not reflect best practices at several different spots, class names and method names are unclear. Some methods are entirely unused and haven't been refactored out. Some of the methods in this project are in need of some enhancement, for instance the parse code where it shows all the users in the chat and the bids list. This really should be done in the cloud with my app sending a users name as a json parameter and the users to be displayed would be people the user has interacted with in some form or another. The bids should show local users based on a geofenced area,etc.This should really be a cloud job, where anyone who has interacted with user X in chat or through a bid would be diplayed in the chat activity. The reason for the this being absent is due to having a free heroku and being limited to what nodejs code I can add. Basically when reading this code please understand that it's in need of a good refactoring, and that I have never done that because I didn't think of ever showing this to anyone, it was my own project.
